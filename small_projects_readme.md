A collection of mini-projects and algorithm practice problems written in Python and JavaScript. This repository includes a variety of games, utilities, and coding exercises that showcase my progress through the **100 Days of Code** and other programming practice.

## Projects included

- **BlackJack** – A simple card game implemented with Python classes and logic.
- **Calculator** – A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
- **Ceaser Cypher** – A program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher.
- **Coffee Machine using OOP** – A simulation of a coffee machine using object-oriented Python.
- **Coffee Machine** – Another version of the coffee machine project.
- **D23 – Turtle Crossing** – A Turtle graphics game where the player helps a turtle cross a busy road.
- **Day 18 – Turtle** – A drawing program using Python’s Turtle module.
- **Day 22 – Pong** – A classic Pong game built with Python's Turtle module.
- **HigherLower Game Day14** – A higher-lower guessing game.
- **Number Guessing Game** – A game where the player guesses a randomly generated number.
- **Snake Game** – A snake game built with Python and Turtle.
- **Secret Auction** – A program to run a secret auction.

## How to run

Each project is contained in its own directory. Navigate into the project directory and run the main Python script. For example:

```bash
cd BlackJack
python blackjack.py
```

Some projects require Python 3.x and may depend on the `turtle` module (included in the Python standard library). Make sure to install any necessary packages before running.
